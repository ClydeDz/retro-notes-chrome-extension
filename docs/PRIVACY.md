# Privacy policy 
This extension does not handle personal or sensitive user data. All notes entered are persisted using [Chrome's storage sync API's](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) and hence available across user devices as long as the user has signed in to Chrome using their Google account and enabled sync. If no sync is enabled, then your notes will be available in the device it was written in only.

None of the notes entered is stored anywhere else externally. This extension also does not collect any information in the background either. No analytics, no cookies, no user information, nothing. Needless to say, no information is shared either. 

Please do not use this extension to store passwords, other personal or sensitive information as this extension was not intended to be built for that purpose.
